Hi, a new bananas report has hust been filed.
Someone has been trying to access app resources for more than<%= @report.class.get_allowed_attempts %>.

Someone's ip address is: <%= @report.ip_address %>

This ip has been blocked.
To unblock it, visit this page: <%= self.send("#{@report.class.snake_name(:plural => true)}_url") + "/#{@report.ip_address}" %>
and delete the report.
